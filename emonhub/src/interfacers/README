Patch for emonhub https://github.com/openenergymonitor/emonhub
to allow messages to be transmitted to solar_EVSE using MQTT

Messages should be in the format

MQTT Topic :   emonhub/tx/<node number>/values
MQTT payload   <value1>,<value2>,...<value n>

The configuration file data/emonhub.conf should contain a stanza in the form

[[54]]
    nodename = solar_EVSE
    firmware =solar_EVSE
    hardware = solar_EVSE
    [[[tx]]]
        names = dacsetpoint
        units = C
        scales = 1
        datacode = h




where 54 is the chosen node number for solar_EVSE and dacsetpoint is the DAC setting.
